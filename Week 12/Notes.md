# Working with JSON 
Javascript object notation is a lightweight text format for storing and sharing data. It looks a lot like a JavaScript object, but it's actually just a string.

Used in web development to:

    Send data from server â†’ client
    Save structured data (like user profiles, settings, etc.)
JSON can represent:
- objects
- arrays
- strings, numbers, booleans
```js
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "isStudent": false
}
```
