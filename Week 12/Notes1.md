# Design For Developers
## Core UI principles
These core principles are your cheat codes to making things look good and feel better.
### Visual Design Principles
#### Contrast
Using differences in color, shape, size, or font weight to draw attention or create separation. This way we can get users to focus more and make things more readable.
#### Typography
How text is styled, including size, weight, spacing, and font choice. It helps because text is 95% of a website so if it's ugly the whole website is ugly. Some of the tips are:
- Don’t use more than 2–3 typefaces. 
- Use proper size hierarchy (headings should feel like headings).
- Line length: keep it 50–75 characters.
#### Visual Hierarchy
Guiding the user's eye using size, color, and position. It is important as people can scan before they read, and you want them to go on a specific order for the website to make sense.
#### Alignment & Grids
Arranging elements along visible lines or grids. It gives clarity and makes it less messy.

#### Whitespace
Empty space between elements. It's good becauuse it gives breathing room, make things scanable and helps focus.

#### Color Theory
Using colors purposefully, not randomly. Some tips:
- Use color to signify meaning (e.g., red = danger, green = success).
- Stick to 1–2 main colors with 1 accent.
- Use a color contrast checker.
#### Images and Icons
- Use high-quality, consistent images.
- Don’t mix photo styles (e.g., flat icons with 3D photos).
- SVGs are great for crispness.
## Core UI principles
As devs, we love to solve puzzles. But the user doesn’t care how elegant our code is—they care that they can buy the thing, read the info, or log in without getting stuck
### Key Concepts
#### You are not the user
Just because you know where to click doesn’t mean your user does.
We make assumptions because we’re close to the product.
Real users click on the wrong thing, get confused, and leave.
#### Design for Accessibility
Designing for everyone helps everyone. This means you should be thinking of all the different people who could need your website, such as colorblind, elderly.
#### User Research & Testing (Very Basics)
Watch a friend use your site. Where do they hesitate? What do they click first? Don’t lead them. Just observe.
#### Comon Design Patterns
These are solutions people already understand. Use them instead of reinventing the wheel.

Cards (for blog posts or product listings)
- Image + title + brief text
- Clickable area
- Often responsive
- Grid or list view

Modal dialogs (for pop-ups)
- Dimmed background
- Focused user interaction
- Dismiss/cancel action clearly available

Breadcrumbs (for navigation)
- Shows hierarchy
- Each section clickable
- Helps users backtrack

Lazy loading (especially for images)
- Faster initial page load
- Placeholder graphics
- Improves perceived performance

Infinite scroll vs pagination
- Infinite scroll: Great for casual browsing
- Pagination: Better for goal-oriented searching

Forms with progress indicators
- Shows user how far they’ve come
- Prevents form fatigue
- Reduces anxiety about completion time
#### Inclusive design
Think about varied experiences and needs from the beginning, not as an afterthought.
Ask yourself “Can everyone use this?” Not just “Does it work on my laptop?”
### Design Brief
A design brief is a short document or conversation that outlines:
- The problem to solve
- The target audience
- The project goals
- Any known constraints (tech stack, timeline, accessibility, branding)
- Deliverables
