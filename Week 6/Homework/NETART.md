As someone that comes from Mexico, a country that forms part of Latin America, as I opened the link I was instantly drawn to the title of this project “NETART LATINO DATABASE”. The project consists of a database of text with links to many works that are all made by Latinos, and it was all the idea of an artist from Uruguay named Brian Mackren, and although it doesn’t function properly nowadays, I feel that what this artist tried to do has a lot of significance.

By being an international student living in New York City one of my goals is to learn from this culture, but also show others what my country has to offer. One way of doing it is through art, as it is one of the things I like the most from Mexico. From the distinctive architecture of the city, to some of the most amazing painters in the world as Frida Khalo. A project like Mackren’s can let people see this but with a technological approach, and it has more value as it can also promote other small artists who want to show their work. 

Another thing that I loved is the layout of the website being a map of latin america, representing each country with their own works of art as a hyperlink. For example for Mexican art the hyperlink is .MX, for Argentina .AR, etc. and although the website is pretty basic, I find it very creative how it uses all the links, because if we see nowadays even documents usually contain them, and he just found a great way of using them.
